# Host-a-Dynamic-Web-App-on-AWS
This course will guide you through the process of deploying a dynamic website on AWS using EC2 servers and various AWS services.


Hosting a dynamic web app on AWS involves several key services to handle the web server, database, and possibly other components like caching and load balancing. Below, I’ll outline a typical architecture for a dynamic web application hosted on AWS and provide a step-by-step guide on setting it up.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** For hosting the web server that will run your web application. You can use EC2 instances to deploy applications written in languages such as Python, Node.js, Java, etc.

2. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):** For managing the backend database. RDS supports several database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

3. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):** To distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring better reliability and fault tolerance.

4. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** For storing static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

5. **Amazon Route 53:** To manage the DNS of your application, ensuring it’s reachable under your chosen domain.

6. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):** To securely control access to AWS services and resources for your application.

7. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk (optional):** For automated deployment and scaling of applications. It’s a good choice if you want to abstract some of the infrastructure management tasks.

### Step-by-Step Setup Guide

#### Step 1: Set Up Amazon EC2
1. **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and click "Launch Instance".
   - Select an appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI), such as Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, etc.
   - Choose an instance type.
   - Configure instance details (number of instances, network, IAM role, etc.).
   - Add storage if needed.
   - Configure security group to allow traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, and any other ports your application might need).
   - Launch the instance with a key pair (create a new one if you don’t have one already).

#### Step 2: Set Up Amazon RDS
1. **Create a Database:**
   - Go to the RDS dashboard in the AWS Console.
   - Click "Create database".
   - Choose the database engine.
   - Configure your database settings (DB instance size, environment, etc.).
   - Set up access permissions and connectivity options.
   - Launch the RDS instance.

#### Step 3: Configure Elastic Load Balancing (Optional)
1. **Set Up ELB:**
   - Navigate to the ELB section in the EC2 dashboard.
   - Create a new load balancer (choose between Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Classic Load Balancer based on your needs).
   - Define the load balancer settings and target groups.
   - Configure health checks for your EC2 instances.
   - Review and create the load balancer.

#### Step 4: Deploy Your Application
1. **Deploy Application to EC2:**
   - Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH.
   - Install necessary software (web server, application dependencies).
   - Deploy your application code (you can use Git to pull from a repository or transfer files directly).
   - Configure the web server to serve your application.

#### Step 5: Configure Route 53
1. **Set Up DNS:**
   - Go to the Route 53 dashboard.
   - Create a new hosted zone for your domain.
   - Add DNS records to point to your EC2 instance or Elastic Load Balancer.

#### Step 6: Secure and Monitor
1. **Implement Security Best Practices:**
   - Set up HTTPS using AWS Certificate Manager or by installing SSL/TLS certificates on your server.
   - Regularly update and patch your server and application.
2. **Monitor Your Application:**
   - Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor instance performance and set up alarms.

By following these steps, you can successfully host a dynamic web application on AWS, leveraging its robust and scalable infrastructure.
